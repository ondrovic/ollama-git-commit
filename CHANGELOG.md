# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `stage-and-commit` script that is a shortcut for running the tool with `--auto-commit` (runs the full staging script, generates a commit message, and commits the currently staged files).
- Enhanced `--auto-stage` flag now runs the full staging script, generates an AI commit message, and shows an interactive prompt, but requires manual commit (user must copy and run the git commit command).
- Enhanced `--auto-commit` flag now runs the full staging script, generates an AI commit message, and if the user approves with 'y', automatically commits with the AI-generated message. Staging is only done once, before message generation.

### Fixed

- Improved version change detection logic for `package-lock.json`: now only reports a version change if the version actually changes and the new version is valid (not '..' or empty). Prevents false positives in commit messages.
- Auto-commit now works with 1Password SSH agent and other SSH agents: the tool runs `git commit` as a foreground process with inherited environment, allowing interactive authentication to work as expected.
- Auto-commit now works with 1Password SSH agent and other SSH agents: the tool runs `git commit` as a foreground process with inherited environment, allowing interactive authentication to work as expected.

### Technical Details

- The version extraction logic for `package-lock.json` and similar files now checks that both old and new versions are present, not equal, and the new version is not '..' or empty before reporting a change. This avoids reporting spurious or truncated version changes in commit messages.
- The auto-commit implementation now uses `spawn` with `stdio: 'inherit'` and inherits the environment, ensuring compatibility with SSH agents like 1Password CLI on all platforms.

## [1.0.13],[1.0.14] - 2025-07-02

### Added

- `config set <key> <value>` command to set configuration values with support for nested keys, boolean parsing, numeric parsing, and array parsing
- `config keys` command to list all available configuration keys with descriptions and default values
- Support for `--all` flag in config set to update all active configuration files

### Fixed

- Config set command tests are now fully mocked, isolated, and reliable. The test suite no longer touches real config files and is deterministic.
- Fixed duplicate "âœ…" in config set command output by removing redundant emoji from logger messages.
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in `config set` command related to `ConfigSources` and nested key assignment. The release process and type generation now succeed without errors.
- Fixed `createConfigUpdate` function to properly handle keys with empty parts (e.g., "a..b", "a."). Previously, such keys would silently fail due to empty string key filtering. Now they correctly create nested objects with empty string keys as intended.
- Fixed a bug where `config set <key> <value>` would overwrite the entire config file instead of merging/appending the new value. Now, only the specified key is updated and all other config values are preserved.
- Setting the `model` key via `config set` now automatically updates the `models` array to keep them in sync. This prevents mismatches between the primary model and the models array.
- Fixed a bug in the configuration auto-sync logic where updating the `model` field would:
  - Fail to add a chat model if none existed in the `models` array
  - Create invalid model entries with empty names if `model` was set to an empty string
  - Overwrite existing custom model configurations in the `models` array instead of preserving them and only updating the relevant chat model
  - Result in inconsistent configuration, potential API failures, and loss of user-defined models

### Changed

- Updated prompts tofurther try and filter out the <think /> processes

### Technical Details

- Updated `displayUpdatedKey` to accept `ConfigSources` as `Record<string, unknown>` via type assertion.
- Added type guards in `createConfigUpdate` to prevent 'undefined' index errors.
- Enhanced `createConfigUpdate` function to process all key parts including empty strings, removing the `if (key)` and `if (lastKey)` checks that were silently filtering out empty key parts.
- Added comprehensive test coverage for keys with empty parts to ensure proper handling of edge cases like "a..b", "a.", ".a", and "a..b..c".
- Improved error handling in nested key creation with proper error messages for invalid key structures.
- Updated config save logic to merge new values with existing config using defaults as a base, ensuring type safety and preventing accidental overwrites.
- Added/expanded tests to verify that config changes merge values and do not overwrite unrelated keys.
- Tests have been added/updated to verify that changing the model also updates the models array accordingly.
- The `saveConfig` method in `ConfigManager` now:
  - Validates the `model` value before updating the `models` array
  - Only updates or adds the chat model, preserving all other custom models
  - Never creates models with empty names
  - Ensures the embeddings model is present if missing
- The test suite (`test/core/config.test.ts`) now includes comprehensive tests for:
  - Auto-syncing the models array when the `model` field is updated
  - Adding a chat model if none exists
  - Skipping auto-sync for invalid model values
  - Preserving custom model configurations when updating the chat model
